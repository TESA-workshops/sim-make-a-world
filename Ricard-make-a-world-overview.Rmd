## Apple orchard

I will show some simulations of the process of estimating the number of apples in an orchard

## Fish growth

I will share some current ideas I am interested in exploring regarding fish growth and the ageing of fish using otoliths

## Collaboration on the GitHub repository sim-make-a-world

Clone or fork the [sim-make-a-world repository]( https://github.com/TESA-workshops/sim-make-a-world.git) which contains all the resources associated with the breakout group

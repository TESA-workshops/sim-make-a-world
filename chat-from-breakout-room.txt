for people working in RStudio you can use the terminal tab (right by the console tab) to type the git commands. If you don't have a terminal tab there, you can use  Tools - New Terminal. Choosing the option under Tools - Terminal Options - New terminal open with "Git Bash" option.

    We seem to be referring to different things re: Linf. I was thinking of it as a population parameter but it seems we're plotting trajectories for individual fish

Could this be adapted to otolith measurments? https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/f02-069

Changes in growth curves could be indicative of environmental impacts on growth, or impacts of fishing on underlying demographics

How is the age assignment of a key affected by the inclusion of non independent  age-length pairs arising from back calculation?

10 minutes of official time left. You have 90 minutes tomorrow to wrap up. Everyone will start again in the main meeting.


[3:53 PM] Forrest, Robyn
    
I think I will have to reassign everyone to groups tomorrow, so if those who can could log on 5-10 minutes early that would help speed things up

Following Alex's comment, looking at individual level variation in growth curves could be informative for assessing the chance of mis-assigning individuals to age classes based on age-length keys

    Regarding the apple example and simplicity, as someone who has not done any simulation modelling, I appreciated the very clear step-by-step example starting with the basics. Thanks Daniel!
